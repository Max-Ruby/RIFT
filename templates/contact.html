      <h1>Contact Info:</h1>
      <p>It's in my resume, which is <a href="../static/Max_Ruby_Resume.pdf">here</a></p>


      <h1>Contact me if:</h1>
      <p>1) You are an image science researcher who wants to collaborate. :D</p>
      <p>2) You want to give me money to do image science stuff. :)</p>
      <p>3) You have found a bug. :(</p>
      <p>4) You are an engineer/programmer working for an organization in charge of developing similar tools and have questions.</p>

      <h1>About:</h1>
      <p>This was made by Max Ruby. That's why it's called Ruby's Image Forensics Toolkit!</p>
      <p>I make no promises about how good this software is. I made this on my free time. It might break things, I don't know.</p>

      <h1>Why make this?</h1>
      <p>1)There's tons of fake images now.</p>
      <p>2)I want H-Index. If you used this for anything publishable, cite the whitepaper.</p>

      <h1>Why CC?</h1>
      <p>Exactly zero researchers will use this if it's paywalled, and I want H-Index.</p>

      <h1>Why non-commercial?</h1>
      <p>Because you can and should do better than this if money's dangled in front of you.</p>

      <h1>How do I support you?</h1>
      <p>If you're a researcher, throw citations my way. The whitepaper (coming soon) is a nice review of image forensics tools, as the author I highly recommend reading it.</p>
      <p>If you're not, throw the code and whitepaper at researchers.</p>

      <h1>General Note:</h1>
      <p>Please note that any output of this program is not definitive proof of anything.</p>
      <p>These tools can be strong indicators that something is fake, but an absence of evidence is not evidence - it may fail to pick up a fake image.</p>
      <p>Moreover, these tools can only determine if aaren image has been manipulated - these tools will never be able to determine if an image was staged or not.</p>
      <p>That is, these tools will never be able to tell the difference between a very good stuffed dog and a real dog!</p>
