RIFT:

Ruby's Image Forensics Toolkit

This is a flask app. You run RIFT_flask.py, open up your browser of choice, then run the app in it.

You will need an environment in which you can run this. There's a requirements.txt in the top level.

More detailed instructions to follow once I grab a non-technical person to help me workshop the instructions.
